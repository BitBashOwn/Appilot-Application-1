# This workflow is disabled. See android-ci.yml for the active CI workflow.
# The original workflow tried to build release APKs which require keystore secrets.
# For CI purposes, we build debug APKs which don't require signing.

# Uncomment and configure the workflow below if you want to build release APKs:
# 1. Add keystore file as base64 encoded secret: KEYSTORE_BASE64  
# 2. Add keystore credentials as secrets: KEYSTORE_PASSWORD, KEY_ALIAS, KEY_PASSWORD
# 3. Add target repository access token: TARGET_REPO_ACCESS_TOKEN
